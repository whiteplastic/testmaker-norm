You are on the administrator's/creator's overview page. This help page offers a general
introduction to the interface, along with a short introduction to using
testMaker.


### Navigation menu (on the left)

The area on the left contains the navigation menu which consists of the
following three areas:

#### Administrative commands

Apart from creating and editing tests, there are several other functions in
testMaker which, depending on your privileges, you can make use of. 
You can *manage user accounts and groups*, and *change your identity* if,
for example, you would like to see what is displayed to a specific participant. 
Moreover, you are able to *export test records*, which you might use in a statistic 
software, or *import and export tests* as a whole. Finally, you can participate in 
published tests, just like everyone else.

#### Navigation for test editing

This area displays a tree-like structure of the test you may work on. This
tree navigation is split into two parts.

The upper part shows the path through the tree structure down to the element you
are currently working on. Therefore it displays a hierarchical list of the elements that
are superior to the current element.

The lower part shows all elements contained in the element you are currently
working on. For example, if you are working on an item block, this area will
list all items of that block.

#### Command buttons

In this area, all possible actions to create sub-elements to the current element. are displayed.
For example, if you are working on a test, you will see buttons to create a
new sub-test, an item block, a text block, or a feedback block.


### Main area (on the right)

The main area on the right displays the editing possibilities for the element you are working on. In many cases, that area is
tabbed, which means that you have several sets of possible operations for the
element. A test, for example, has a tab "General" for viewing and editing general
information about the test, "Permissions2 for setting permissions, "Structure" for changing the ordering of the
elements in the test, and so on.


### Quick start

To create a test, use the button "create new test". You are then taken to the
settings page of the new tests. 

To impose a certain level of structure on the elements you create in that test, you may use so-called sub-tests. 
In tests or sub-tests, you can create several types of elements, such as item
blocks or feedback blocks. For each of those, separate settings pages exist.

Please note that tests are not available to the general public until you
assign the relevant permissions. For more information on permissions, see the
["permissions" help page](func_pagelink('', edit_perms)).
