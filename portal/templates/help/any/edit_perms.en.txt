On this page you can define permissions for the various groups of test
creators. This allows you to decide who can...

* publish your tests (by setting the above permissions),
* see your tests in the editor,
* create new sub-blocks (such as sub-tests, item blocks, ...) within your
  tests,
* edit your tests in the editor,
* delete your tests,
* copy or move your blocks to another place or link them into other tests.

Additionally, you can give other authors the opportunity to try out your test
via the test overview, a direct link or TAN access without having to publish
the test.

Of course, all these operations are automatically available to you for your
own tests, but other users (except administrators) will not even know that
your test exists at all. If you want to share your test with co-workers or do
collaborative work on it, you can assign the corresponding permissions on this
page.

The administrators may have restricted the authors' abilities to decide who
may publish tests; in that case, please talk to the administrators if you want
to publish your test.


### User groups

All users are part of a number of groups. The members and global permissions
of each group are defined by the administators of this instance of testMaker.
The administrators are responsible for maintaining this instance of testMaker
and for this purpose, they also have implicit full permissions on everything.

Generally, new groups are useful for giving only certain people access to your
tests, or to restrict participation to certain people.

Let's say that a team of test developers wants to work together on an
assessment test. An administrator creates a new group (probably called
"Assessment Developers") and assigns all members of the team to that group.
Now, you can create a new test and give the group "Assessment Developers"
permissions of your choice, which allows all members of the assessment team to
make use of them.

Since groups can only be managed by administrators, please talk to one of them
if you need permissions for a group of people that isn't defined in testMaker.

#### Why are groups of prospective test participants not listed here?

For obvious reasons, test participants should not be able to modify your test
or view information like which answers are correct for a given item. To this
end, all you can do regarding these groups is publish tests for them in "Publication".

#### Creators group

This group usually contains all users who are allowed to create new tests, so
you can assign permissions to this group to, for example, allow your fellow
creators to use parts of your tests in their own.

Your local testMaker administrators may be using a different set of groups to
assign creation permissions; in that case, contact one of them to learn how
you can share your tests with your co-workers.


### Option "Apply these permissions to all subordinate blocks"

This option is enabled by default and causes all permissions you set for tests
to be applied to all subordinate blocks (sub-tests, item blocks etc.), including
subordinate blocks you add after assigning these permissions.

While it is possible to disable this option for selected tests, we do not
recommend to do so; it is generally not necessary anyway.

If you want to assign broader or stricter permissions to a specific subordinate block
of your test, just go to that block's "permissions" tab where you can assign
separate permissions after assigning the permissions for the rest of the test.
